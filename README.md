## Inspiration

Sustainable finance – the integration of environmental, social, and governance factors into the investment decision-making process – has been a trending topic in financial markets in recent years as investors’ money flowed into bonds, stocks, and portfolios with an ESG focus. This trend towards allocating capital for ESG assets and goals is a crucial part of the transformation towards a more sustainable economy.Moreover, everyone should understand these concepts to amplify the beneficial effect on society and induce a change in investment habits for retail investors. As a result, sustainable finance literacy – meaning an understanding of sustainable financial products and their use for promoting sustainable development goals – plays a key role in the integration of ESG factors into financial decisions. The first step in achieving sustainable finance literacy is creating awareness. While the financial sector is advancing at great speed towards integrating ESG factors in financial decision-making, teaching sustainable finance lags behind. Teaching sustainable finance courses is therefore essential. However, to create awareness we need more than specialized courses and here when **ESGROW** was born.
